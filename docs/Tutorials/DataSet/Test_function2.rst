Simple Test2
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a simple test to check if the tutorial class is working as expected. Below is the trial code:

>>> from MJOLNIR.Data import DataSet
>>> from MJOLNIR import _tools
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> file = '/home/lass/Dropbox/PhD/CAMEAData/camea2018n000137.hdf'
>>>  
>>> DataObj = DataSet.DataSet(dataFiles=file) # Open file
>>> # Woop woop, this is the second test!
>>> print(DataObj)
>>>  

The above code should have been pasted and all is good.....
