30/10-18 - Opening of shutter and background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Things done today:

- Opening of shutter
    - The neutron guide is not suitably under vacuum and needs to be fixed by turning on pump(s).
    - After restart of pumps and security checks the main shutter and secondary shutter are allowed to be opened.
    - Test of shutter closing when triggered by alarm (beam stop button, malfunctioning external safety system).

- Check of software
    - Streaming of data through the UDP pipline as well as direct logging tested to be functional.
    - Connections between Six and motors, monitors confirmed.
    - Slight reajustment of data path way from detector to histogram memory is needed as data becomes skewed.

- Measurements
    - Background measurement of full tank for 83 minutes with a total of around 2500 counts or 0.3 count/(minut tube).
