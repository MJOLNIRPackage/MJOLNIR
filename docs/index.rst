Welcome to MJOLNIR's documentation!
===================================
Welcome to the documentation page of the MJOLNIR software package developed for data treatment, conversion, and visualization for multiplexing neutron scattering 
spectrometers. With the increased point density measured during a single experiment, flexible and versatile software is needed to deal with this new data. This 
software package tries to both introduce an easy-to-use scripting interface to visualization and treatment while still offering customizable plotting features.
